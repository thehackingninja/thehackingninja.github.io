This is the guide that will make sure you have a **hard start** in hacking and you don&#39;t have to spend countless hours researching stuff.

Research is Great but a good **direction** is always needed.

1. Step by step guide to help you put on a **path** of learning to hack.
2. How to have a side income by **bug bounty hunting**.
3. What are different **sources** you must follow to learn about interesting things in this domain?

**Who is this for :**

1. Anyone who wants to learn hacking.
2. Anyone who thinks he/she is misguided by the internet
3. Anyone who wants to explore the world of compute networking / ethical hacking

**What this guide is not?**

1. This is not a tutorial, this is a guide. This will tell you what to do and where to find the resources to do it.
2. This guide is not a complete hacker&#39;s playbook.
3. This is not &quot;how to hack insta&quot; guides.

Lets clear some things first, this is not a guide that will make you a hacking wizard in a day or two. Hacking is a skill that needs **years to practice** and this guide will put you on the right track.

If you are here to know how to hack someone&#39;s account then again **kindly don&#39;t read this**.

If you are passionate about computer systems in general and problem solving then you are the one who should read this.

This does not contain tutorials but it&#39;s just a guide that will tell you what&#39;s what and where you can learn.

**Hacking IS computer networking nothing more, nothing less.**

It&#39;s not magic but it comes close to it.

**FAQ**

**I don&#39;t know a lot about computer science, Can I still learn ethical hacking?**

Sure you can!! Anybody can learn anything! You just need consistency and a love for hacking. Follow this guide and you will be in love with it in no time.

**I don&#39;t have a good computer, Can I still hack?**

Most intelligent hacks don&#39;t need that much power or networking power. You can even launch attacks from your phones!!

**What is hacking?**

Hacking is a layman term for computer networking. It is basically finding loopholes / things you can take advantage of, in a system and take the control of a victim machine.

**What is ethical hacking?**

Detectives have to think like thieves to catch them. That&#39;s why cybersecurity testers have to think like a hacker to prevent hacks from happening. The people who only use the power of hacking for good are ethical hackers.

**What is Penetration Testing?**

It is basically running automated tests and providing test results for the company and providing reports on what to do to fix the loop holes they have found in the particular software / hardware.

**How to use this guide?**

- Read it once for an overall idea of learning to hack.
- Then I have given links everywhere, go through them. Not once but twice.
- And just follow this guide and become a good hacker and **remember all good hackers are life hackers.**
